This is SUBstance.</p> <p>About Gladiator: <a href="www.gladiator-music.com"></a> <a href="soundcloud.com/gladiator"></a></p> <p>Born out of a passion for DJing, Gladiator was conceived in 2010 by Los Angeles natives Daniel Goodman and Ian Johnson. The duo is known for bringing an irresistible sense of fun and passion to every show with their unique genre-bending sets. After debuting with a series of self-released internet uploads and bootleg remixes, Gladiator joined the A-Trak led label Fool’s \Gold and released their first official EP Assembly Line in 2014. Following this release they found the opportunity to make official remixes for the likes of Low Pros & Juvenile’s “Muscle,” Skrillex’s “Dirty Vibe” and Melanie Martinez’s “Soap,” as well as singles such as “Cruise Control” and “Cute” with fellow Fool’s \Gold artists Sleepy Tom and Kittens.</p>'
